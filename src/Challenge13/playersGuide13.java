/*Objectives:       Watchtower

Ask the user for an x value and a y value. These are coordinates of
the enemy relative to the watchtower’s location. Positive x-values are east, positive y-values are north (as they would be on a normal graph)
Using if statements and relational operators, display a message about what direction the enemy is coming from. For example, “The enemy is to the northwest!” or “The enemy is here!
